# Open World

A work-in-progress. The goal of this project is to be a self-hosted social experience.

I'm currently adding a chatroom feature and hope to add some sort of game to it as well (perhaps something RPG-ish?).

Not sure what this will end up being, but I hope it'll be fun!

## Design Philosophy

- Open World should function without internet access.
  - Someone should be able to host this on a LAN without issue.
  - Future third-party functionality should be optional and not required.
- Users should be able to create their own clients to interact with the Open World server.
  - If someone wants to write their own web app, console app, etc. to interact, they should be able to do so with no restrictions.
